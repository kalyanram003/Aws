AWS services: API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Lambda.

ðŸ”¹ API Gateway: Utilized AWS API Gateway to create, deploy, and manage secure APIs. This service enabled seamless communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring smooth and secure data transfer.

ðŸ”¹ DynamoDB: Leveraged AWS DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database service, to handle our application's data storage needs. DynamoDB's low latency and high scalability were crucial for our application's performance.

ðŸ”¹ Lambda: Employed AWS Lambda to run code in response to triggers from API Gateway and DynamoDB streams. This serverless compute service allowed us to execute backend functions without provisioning or managing servers, resulting in a more efficient and cost-effective solution.
